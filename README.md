# Capstone-Bangkit
We created the mobile application that can help identify skin diseases (Chickenpox, scabies, tinea versicolor, and herpes). Which will give advice on the first treatment or certain drugs before going to dermatologist. 
And we expected to help time efficiency for puskesmas/medical clinic officers in patient treatment services. So for patients who want to consultation with doctor, they don't interfere with patients who are waiting to be examined by a doctor immediately.
